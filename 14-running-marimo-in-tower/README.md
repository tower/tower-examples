# 🚀 Marimo in the Tower!

Welcome to the most interactive way to run notebooks in the cloud! This example shows how to deploy a [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook using Tower's infrastructure.

## 🎯 What's This About?

Ever wanted to turn your data science notebooks into interactive web apps that actually *work* in production? This project combines:

- **🐍 Marimo**: The reactive Python notebook that doesn't hate you
- **⚡ FastAPI**: Because we need that web server magic
- **🏗️ Tower**: Your friendly neighborhood deployment platform

## 🎮 What You Get

Fire up this app and you'll see:

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: A slider that actually does things!
- 📈 **Real-time Plotting**: Watch matplotlib charts update as you slide
- ✨ **Reactive Magic**: Change one thing, everything else updates automatically

No more "run all cells and pray" - this is notebook computing done right!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Deploy with Tower:**
   ```bash
   tower deploy
   ```

2. **Watch the magic happen:**
   - Your notebook spins up at the provided URL
   - Drag that slider around like it owes you money
   - Marvel at the beautiful square root plot that updates in real-time

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── main.py          # FastAPI server that wraps our notebook
├── notebook.py      # The actual Marimo notebook with interactive widgets
├── Towerfile        # Tower deployment configuration
├── pyproject.toml   # Python dependencies
└── README.md        # You are here! 👋
```

## 🔧 How It Works

The magic happens in a few key steps:

1. **`notebook.py`** defines your interactive Marimo cells with widgets and plots
2. **`main.py`** wraps the notebook in a FastAPI ASGI app
3. **Tower** handles all the deployment heavy lifting
4. **You** get to play with an interactive dashboard in your browser!

## 🎨 Customize It

Want to make this notebook your own? Try:

- Add more interactive widgets in `notebook.py`
- Experiment with different matplotlib visualizations  
- Connect to real data sources
- Add more cells with different chart types

The beauty of Marimo is that everything stays reactive - add a new widget and watch how it automatically connects to your existing code!

## 🤔 Why Marimo?

Unlike traditional notebooks that turn into a mess of hidden state and execution order problems, Marimo notebooks:

- ✅ **Always work**: No more "works on my machine" notebook nightmares
- 🔄 **Stay in sync**: Change one cell, dependent cells update automatically
- 🎯 **Deploy easily**: Turn notebooks into web apps without the usual pain
- 📱 **Look great**: Interactive widgets that actually feel modern

## 🎉 Next Steps

Ready to build something awesome? This example gives you the foundation to:

- Create data dashboards that stakeholders will actually use
- Build interactive reports that update with live data
- Deploy ML models with user-friendly interfaces
- Make notebooks that your future self won't hate

Happy coding! 🎈
